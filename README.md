# Coding Assistant 

## Tech Stack: 
Python, Ollama Models, PyTorch and Lamma_Index

### Purpose: 
I want to build something similar to Cody AI Coding assistant and Learn more about AI models and how they work!

### Features Implemented:
1. Ability to Parse PDF docs
2. Ability to generate code as per requirement shared

### Upcoming Features
1. Generate files in editor with suggested code
2. FineTuning larger models to replace deepseek-coder with codellama
3. Adding GUI to enable users to upload their files rather than transferring it to folder directory
4. Virtualizing the environments
5. Adding support for DOCX and TXT files
6. Adding supporting commands on how to use the AI (/help) commands
